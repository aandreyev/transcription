  naming_extraction: "Create a complete filename for this file relating to a legal\
    \ meeting. Use the original filename and transcript as the source of information\
    \ to construct a well-formed file name following the conventions and style set\
    \ out below.\n\n**Filename Format:** [Date] [Type] with [Names] re [Topic] - [Duration]min\
    \ [MatterNumber]\n\nWhere:\n  [DATE] - This is the date of the meeting. This can\
    \ usually be extracted from the original filename. It is usually a 8-digit date\
    \ in the format YYYYMMDD. This is NOT the date that the file is transcribed.\n\
    \n  [Type] - This is the type of meeting that has been recorded and transcribed.\
    \ Common types of meeting are 'Calls', 'Meetings', 'Interviews', 'Presentations'.\
    \ This can usually be extracted from the original filename. However, sometimes\
    \ it needs to be determined from the transcript itself. Common shorthand includes\
    \ 'TA' for 'Call' and 'MTG' for 'Meeting'.\n\n  [Names] - These are the names\
    \ of people involved in the meeting. The original filename usually includes at\
    \ least one Name. Sometimes it is a single name (e.g. John), and sometimes it\
    \ is a full first and second name (e.g. 'John Smith'). Sometimes it is more than\
    \ one name, (e.g. John and Karen).\n\n  [Topic] - This is the main topic of the\
    \ meeting. This can usually be extracted from the original filename (e.g. 're\
    \ estate administration'). However, if there is no main topic in the original\
    \ file name, you will need to use the transcript to extract the topic.\n\n  [Duration]\
    \ - This is the duration of the meeting in minutes. This can usually be extracted\
    \ from the original filename.\n\n  [MatterNumber] - This is the 5-digit matter\
    \ number that corresponds to our practice management system. You can identify\
    \ it by square brackets or underscores (e.g. [12345] or _12345_). They are usualy\
    \ at the end of the original filename.\n\n**Good Examples:**\n- 20250526 TA with\
    \ Michael Murray re Data Patents - 15min [12345]\n- 20250523 TA with Anthony re\
    \ Pickles Schoolwear Sale - 30min [52634]\n- 20250715 Call with Michael Fox re\
    \ Tax Advice - 8min\n\n**CRITICAL ERRORS TO AVOID:**\n- ❌ \"20250720 20250526\
    \ TA Michael Murray\" (duplicate dates - use ONLY the original file date)\n- ❌\
    \ \"TA Anthony re Pickles Schoolwear sale - Processed\" (never add \"Processed\"\
    )\n- ❌ \"Call with Rob Veitch and Veitch\" (duplicate last names)\n- ❌ \"re Michael\
    \ Fox re Michael Fox\" (person as topic)\n\n**RULES:**\n1. Use ONLY the date from\
    \ the original filename (not today's date)\n2. NEVER add \"Processed\" or similar\
    \ suffixes or prefixes\n3. Extract participants and topic from transcript when\
    \ necessary\n4. Keep it clean and professional\n\nReturn ONLY the complete filename,\
    \ nothing else:\n\n20250526 TA with Michael Murray re Data Patents - 15min [12534]\n\
    \n**Original Filename:** {original_filename}\n**Transcript:** {transcript}\n"
  filename_validation: 'Review this filename and fix any issues. Make it professional
    and logical.


    **Proposed:** {proposed_filename}

    **Original:** {original_filename}


    **CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:**

    - ❌ Duplicate dates: "20250720 20250526 TA" → "20250526 TA"

    - ❌ "Processed" suffix: "re Topic - Processed" → "re Topic"

    - ❌ Duplicate names: "John Smith and Smith" → "John Smith"

    - ❌ Person as topic: "re John Smith" → use actual topic or remove

    - ❌ Duplicate words: "re re Topic" → "re Topic"


    If the filename has issues, return ONLY the corrected filename.

    If the filename is fine, return ONLY the word "VALID".


    Examples:

    - Input: "20250720 20250526 TA Michael Murray" → Output: "20250526 TA Michael
    Murray"

    - Input: "20250526 TA Anthony re Pickles - Processed" → Output: "20250526 TA Anthony
    re Pickles"

    - Input: "20250526 TA Michael Murray re Data Patents - 15min" → Output: "VALID"
